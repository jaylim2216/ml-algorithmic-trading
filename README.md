### Dynamic Cluster-Based Portfolio Optimization in S&P 500 Stocks

This quantitative finance project employs an unsupervised machine learning approach, specifically K-Means clustering, to develop a dynamic trading strategy for S&P 500 stocks. It begins by fetching and preparing historical stock data, calculating various technical indicators and liquidity measures, and then integrating Fama-French factors to understand market risks. Stocks are clustered based on their features, and portfolios are formed monthly from the most liquid cluster, optimized for maximum Sharpe ratio using the Efficient Frontier method. The strategy's performance is dynamically calculated and compared against the S&P 500 benchmark to assess its effectiveness. The project encapsulates data-driven asset selection, risk management, and performance evaluation, aiming to create a robust algorithmic trading strategy that adapts to market conditions and outperforms standard benchmarks.
